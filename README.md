This project aims to stream line the grocery list making process by combining ingredients from a user-created list of recipes into a concise grocery list.

Planned features:
- search for recipes by name
- filter search results by:
    - category
    - ingredients
    - dietary tags
    - prep/cook time
- create lists of recipes that will generate a combined grocery list
- edit grocery lists to add items not in recipes and remove items not needed
- add recipes to a recipe bank
